# Rune Engine
This is a game engine written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/).

My goals for this project are for it to be:

* Simple
* Fast
* Cross-platform
* and Extendable

# Building
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/IEatNickles/rune-engine
```
## Windows
Not supported yet (though `build.sh` _might_ work).
## Linux
Run the `build.sh` script
## Mac
See [Windows](#windows) (maybe idk)

# Roadmap (in no particular order)
- [ ] make a rendering engine
- [ ] make a scene system
- [ ] make a physics system with [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics)
- [ ] make a GUI editor
- [ ] make a scripting engine
- [ ] profit?

[Here is a Trello board](https://trello.com/b/2UwnTTkS/todo), it'll have more details about stuff and probably be more up-to-date (maybe).
